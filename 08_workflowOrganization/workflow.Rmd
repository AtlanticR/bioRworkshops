The goal of this workshop is to go over a number of "best practices" for organizing R "projects", and workflows. The reasons for doing this are plenty:

* reproducibility: both between different collaborators, and with yourself when you try and re-run code at a later time (maybe after switching computers, etc)

* organization of data/scripts/documents (e.g. to be able to find things again)

* avoiding pitfalls that affect results
